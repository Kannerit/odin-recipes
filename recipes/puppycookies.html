    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Dog Treats</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 cup peanut butter</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>2 TBSP honey</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Frosting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 TBSP peanut butter</li>
      <li>1 TBSP honey</li>
      <li>1/3 cup cornstarch</li>
      <li>3-4 TBSP hot water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine flour and the egg. Add the peanut butter,
        water, and honey, and stir until you have a stiff dough. The dough
        becomes very firm and sticky. You may need to use your hands, or the
        paddle attachment on your mixer. 2½ cups whole wheat flour,1 large egg,1
        cup peanut butter,1 cup water,2 tablespoons honey
      </li>
      <li>
        On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough about ½-inch thick and
        use a cookie cutter to make fun shapes. The treats barely spread and
        rise, so get creative with your shapes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 18-20 minutes, until golden. Once done, set aside to cool. (If
        you have smaller cookies, use less time, otherwise the bottom might
        burn.)
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the frosting, combine the peanut butter and honey in a
        microwavable bowl, and heat in the microwave in 15 second increments,
        stirring in between, until melted. 2 tablespoons peanut butter,1
        tablespoon honey
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the melted peanut butter mixture to the cornstarch and stir until
        just combined. ⅓ cup cornstarch
      </li>
      <li>
        Slowly add in the water 1 tablespoon at a time until you have reached
        the consistency that you would like. For a thinner frosting, add more
        water. 3-4 tablespoons hot water
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the frosting to a piping bag and pipe designs on top of each dog
        treat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Frost the treats with the peanut butter/honey mixture for an even more
        tempting cookie.
      </li>
    </ol>
