        <ul>
            <li>10 fresh strawberries, chopped</li>
            <li>1 medium, ripe banana</li>
            <li>1 cup (280grs) natural plain yogurt(lowfat/nonfat)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mash the strawberries using a potato masher. You want very small pieces of fruit so your dog can swallow it easily.</li>
            <li>Add in the banana and continue to mash, almost to puree</li>
            <li>Stir in the yogurt and mix all ingredients until well-combined</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into freezer safe air-tight containers and then freeze for a minimum of 4 hours but preferably overnight. Ice cube trays are good to make small portions.</li>
            <li>Take treating your dog a step further by turning it into an ice cream sundae party!</li>
            <li>Keep the Ice Cream in the freezer for 8 weeks.</li>
            <li>* If you want the ice cream to be scoopable use Greek/Strained yogurt.</li>
        </ol>
